# Spark Streaming Project - Udacity Data Streaming Nanodegree


## Project Overview

You work for the data science team at STEDI, a small startup focused on assessing balance for seniors. STEDI has an application that collects data from seniors during a small exercise. The user logs in and then selects the customer they are working with. Then the user starts a timer and clicks a button with each step the senior takes. When the senior has reached 30 steps, their test is finished. The data transmitted enables the application to monitor seniorsâ€™ balance risk.
